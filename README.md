# Sinatra Reservation CMS

I wrote this Reservation System in Ruby, specifically using Sinatra, to demonstrate how to create a basic application with which a user can create an account and login as well as create, read, update, and delete reservations for resources such as vehicles.

## How to Install

Clone this repository, run bundle in your terminal, run rake dB:migrate in your terminal to create the database, and run shotgun to start the application locally.

## Contributor's Guide
